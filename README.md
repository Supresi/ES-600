1. Determine correlation structures (in form of matrices) among quality parameters separately for Collection tank (CT) and Groundwater (GW). For example: pH with other parameters in CT and likewise in GW, etc.
2. Determine the correlation between each quality parameter of leachate (in CT) with GW. For example: pH of CT with GW, etc.
3. Write down a brief conclusion on the results. (state your assumptions â€“ if any).
